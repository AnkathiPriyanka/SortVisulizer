# SortVisulizer
This HTML code represents a Sorting Visualizer web application. It allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. The application provides a container for displaying an array of elements, a selection of sorting algorithms to choose from, and options to customize the array size and sorting speed.

The visualizer utilizes Bootstrap CSS for styling and Google Fonts for typography. It includes custom CSS styles defined in the "style.css" file and uses a custom favicon. The main functionality is implemented in JavaScript, with separate script files for each sorting algorithm.

To use the application, users can select a sorting algorithm from the available options and click the "Sort" button to visualize the sorting process. They can also randomize the array using the "Randomize" button. The array size and sorting speed can be adjusted using sliders provided.
